# rtpPayload_ttml

This python library provides a means to decode, encode, and interact with TTML RTP payloads. It is designed for use with an RTP library such as [RTP](https://github.com/bbc/rd-apmm-python-lib-rtp). It only encodes/decodes the payload bitstreams. It DOES NOT provide a means to render or edit TTML documents.
